# TX - Deep Learning Methods for Dog Breed Identification

## Description

This project involves the development of an iOS application that uses deep learning methods to identify dog breeds. Users can take a photo of a dog, and the application will be capable of recognizing its breed and storing this information for future use. The project was conducted as part of a school project at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC) in 2023.
